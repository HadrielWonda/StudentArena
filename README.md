## Overview
### Description
Allows students access a variety of property and accessories within their circle for sale, lease (marketplace). Generally items like used books are mostly predominant among peers, finding rental homes off campus or shared housing. Each sale is connected to a user or school store account (details on how to meet), giving  some background information on the person you are buying from or selling to.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential checking the latest products with Location GPS. The camera is used to take pictures of items for sale.
- **Story:** Easier transaction and more availability of student required items
- **Market:** Students that has interest in buying or selling an item. Student stores could later be monetized later for post on the marketplace. 
- **Habit:** Post notification to remind them of item visited. Could expand to direct messaging for users.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow students to post things for sale like books, accessories, post accomodation off campus (Option for shared appartment). V2 would incorperate filters to search items.
